NAME
       grep, egrep, fgrep, rgrep - print lines matching a pattern

SYNOPSIS
       grep [OPTIONS] PATTERN [FILE...]
       grep [OPTIONS] [-e PATTERN]...  [-f FILE]...  [FILE...]

DESCRIPTION
       grep  searches  the  named  input  FILEs for lines containing a match to the
       given PATTERN.  If no files are specified, or if the file “-” is given, grep
       searches standard input.  By default, grep prints the matching lines.

       In  addition,  the  variant  programs egrep, fgrep and rgrep are the same as
       grep -E, grep -F, and grep -r, respectively.  These variants are deprecated,
       but are provided for backward compatibility.

OPTIONS
   Generic Program Information
       --help Output a usage message and exit.

       -V, --version
              Output the version number of grep and exit.

   Matcher Selection
       -E, --extended-regexp
              Interpret PATTERN as an extended regular expression (ERE, see below).

       -F, --fixed-strings
              Interpret  PATTERN  as  a  list  of fixed strings (instead of regular
              expressions), separated by newlines, any of which is to be matched.

       -G, --basic-regexp
              Interpret PATTERN as a basic regular  expression  (BRE,  see  below).
              This is the default.

       -P, --perl-regexp
              Interpret  PATTERN  as  a  Perl regular expression (PCRE, see below).
              This is highly experimental and grep -P  may  warn  of  unimplemented
              features.

   Matching Control
       -e PATTERN, --regexp=PATTERN
              Use  PATTERN  as  the  pattern.   Multiple  -e can be used to specify
              different search patterns.  This option is also useful to  protect  a
              pattern beginning with a hyphen (-).

       -f FILE, --file=FILE
              Obtain  patterns  from  FILE,  one per line.  The empty file contains
              zero patterns, and therefore matches nothing.   Multiple  -f  can  be
              used to specify different files.

       -i, --ignore-case
              Ignore case distinctions in both the PATTERN and the input files.

       -v, --invert-match
              Invert the sense of matching, to select non-matching lines.

       -w, --word-regexp
              Select  only  those  lines  containing matches that form whole words.
              The test is that  the  matching  substring  must  either  be  at  the
              beginning  of  the  line,  or  preceded  by  a  non-word  constituent
              character.  Similarly, it must be either at the end of  the  line  or
              followed  by  a  non-word  constituent  character.   Word-constituent
              characters are letters, digits, and the underscore.

       -x, --line-regexp
              Select only those matches that exactly match the whole line.   For  a
              and then surrounding it with ^ and $.

       -y     Obsolete synonym for -i.

   General Output Control
       -c, --count
              Suppress normal output; instead print a count of matching  lines  for
              each  input  file.   With  the -v, --invert-match option (see below),
              count non-matching lines.

       --color[=WHEN], --colour[=WHEN]
              Surround the matched (non-empty)  strings,  matching  lines,  context
              lines,  file  names,  line numbers, byte offsets, and separators (for
              fields and groups of context lines) with escape sequences to  display
              them  in  color  on  the  terminal.   The  colors  are defined by the
              environment  variable  GREP_COLORS.    The   deprecated   environment
              variable GREP_COLOR is still supported, but its setting does not have
              priority.  WHEN is never, always, or auto.

       -L, --files-without-match
              Suppress normal output; instead print the name  of  each  input  file
              from  which no output would normally have been printed.  The scanning
              will stop on the first match.

NAME
     cal, ncal — displays a calendar and the date of Easter

SYNOPSIS
     cal [-3hjy] [-A number] [-B number] [[month] year]
     cal [-3hj] [-A number] [-B number] -m month [year]
     ncal [-3bhjJpwySM] [-A number] [-B number] [-s country_code] [[month] year]
     ncal [-3bhJeoSM] [-A number] [-B number] [year]
     ncal [-CN] [-H yyyy-mm-dd] [-d yyyy-mm]

DESCRIPTION
     The cal utility displays a simple calendar in traditional format and ncal
     offers an alternative layout, more options and the date of Easter.  The new
     format is a little cramped but it makes a year fit on a 25x80 terminal.  If
     arguments are not specified, the current month is displayed.

     The options are as follows:

     -h      Turns off highlighting of today.

     -J      Display Julian Calendar, if combined with the -o option, display date
             of Orthodox Easter according to the Julian Calendar.

     -e      Display date of Easter (for western churches).

     -j      Display Julian days (days one-based, numbered from January 1).

     -m month
             Display the specified month.  If month is specified as a decimal num‐
             ber, appending ‘f’ or ‘p’ displays the same month of the following or
             previous year respectively.

     -o      Display date of Orthodox Easter (Greek and Russian Orthodox Churches).

     -p      Print the country codes and switching days from Julian to Gregorian
             Calendar as they are assumed by ncal.  The country code as determined
             from the local environment is marked with an asterisk.

     -s country_code
             Assume the switch from Julian to Gregorian Calendar at the date asso‐
             ciated with the country_code.  If not specified, ncal tries to guess
             the switch date from the local environment or falls back to September
             2, 1752.  This was when Great Britain and her colonies switched to the
             Gregorian Calendar.

     -w      Print the number of the week below each week column.

     -y      Display a calendar for the specified year. This option is implied when
             a year but no month are specified on the command line.

     -3      Display the previous, current and next month surrounding today.

     -1      Display only the current month. This is the default.

     -A number
             Months to add after. The specified number of months is added to the
             end of the display. This is in addition to any date range selected by
             the -y, -3, or -1 options. For example, “cal -y -B2 -A2” shows every‐
             thing from November of the previous year to February of the following
             year. Negative numbers are allowed, in which case the specified number
             of months is subtracted. For example, “cal -y -B-6” shows July to
             December. And “cal -A11” simply shows the next 12 months.

     -B number
             Months to add before. The specified number of months is added to the
             beginning of the display. See -A for examples.

     -C      Switch to cal mode.

     -N      Switch to ncal mode.

     -d yyyy-mm
             Use yyyy-mm as the current date (for debugging of date selection).

     -H yyyy-mm-dd
             Use yyyy-mm-dd as the current date (for debugging of highlighting).

     -M      Weeks start on Monday.

     -S      Weeks start on Sunday.

     -b      Use oldstyle format for ncal output.

     A single parameter specifies the year (1–9999) to be displayed; note the year
     must be fully specified: “cal 89” will not display a calendar for 1989.  Two
     parameters denote the month and year; the month is either a number between 1
     and 12, or a full or abbreviated name as specified by the current locale.
     Month and year default to those of the current system clock and time zone (so
     “cal -m 8” will display a calendar for the month of August in the current
     year).

     Not all options can be used together. For example, the options -y, -3, and -1
     are mutually exclusive. If inconsistent options are given, the later ones take
     precedence over the earlier ones.

     A year starts on January 1.
